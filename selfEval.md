# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators? It is certainly a little stressful, but I think I am slowly grasping and becoming more fluent. There is a lot of moving parts, and I struggle more with the ORDER that things need to be done in. It is interesting to play around with the code, and it helps me understand if I am doing it correctly.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators? Logical operators have been very easy for me to learn and grasp.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements? I think I understand is perfectly, but I am by no means "fluent" in it just yet. 
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate? I spent roughly 2 hours on it, which is just around the time I allotted (maybe a little less!)
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? I need to hammer in the learning by actually writing more code. I have set aside 4 hours tomorrow (1/13/2024) to dedicate to writing code.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? Questions come up but I try to be resourceful and use online resources to see if I can get my question answered. If I am not able to find the answer, or need further clarification, I use the Slack channel and request help from my cohort mates!
